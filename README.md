Prediction of Agriculture Crop Production in India
Problem Statement:
Farming is one of the major sectors that influences a countryâ€™s economic growth. In agriculture field, farmer has to know about the suitable crops for cultivation. Growing crops are completely based on the type of the soil and its features, location, whether etc. Now a days analyzing soil and its features are entirely manual which requires more time. This leads to the development of the automation for crop prediction based on the soil features. Many new technologies, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning, are being implemented into agriculture so that it is easier for farmers to grow and maximize their yield. In this project, We present a website in which the following applications are implemented; Crop recommendation, Fertilizer recommendation respectively
